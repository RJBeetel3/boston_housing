# boston_housing
Udacity project using decision tree regressor to predict housing prices in Boston based on factors like the number of rooms, the student to teacher ratio in schools and the percentage of low income people in the area. The data was collected in the late 1970's and would likely not be applicable in today's market. The model wasn't terribly applicable in that market if I'm honest. It over estimated housing prices and had quite a bit of variance.
